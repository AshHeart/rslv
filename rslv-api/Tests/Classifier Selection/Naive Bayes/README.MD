This is the Second step, we learn to use classifiers here for our supervised machine learning tasks

Specifically The Naive Bayes classifier is used in this repo

Files will contain giudes to what they do as usual
The repo is expected to store generally useful machine learning stuff too...
like dataset cleansers and other suff
